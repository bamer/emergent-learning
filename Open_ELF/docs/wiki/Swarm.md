# Swarm: Multi-Agent Coordination

**Requires Pro or Max plan** - Free plan can't use Task tool for subagents.

## What It Does

Swarm coordinates multiple Opencode subagents with specialized personas. Each agent brings domain expertise to your task.

## Using Swarm

```bash
/swarm investigate the authentication system    # Start task
/swarm show                                     # View state
/swarm reset                                    # Clear and restart
/swarm stop                                     # Stop all agents
```

**Example:**
```
You: /swarm implement a new REST API

Claude: ## Swarm Plan
        **Task:** Implement REST API

        ### Recommended Agents:

        CORE:
        [x] backend-architect (opus) - API design, microservices
        [x] security-auditor (opus) - Security review

        SUPPORT:
        [ ] test-automator (sonnet) - Test coverage
        [ ] api-documenter (sonnet) - OpenAPI docs

        Proceed? [Y/n]
```

## Agent Pool (100 Specialists)

ELF integrates **100 specialized agents** from [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents).

### Install

```bash
./tools/setup/install-agents.sh
```

This installs:
- Agents to `~/.opencode/agents/`
- Agent catalog to `~/.opencode/agents/agent-catalog.json`
- Updated `/swarm` command

### Task-to-Agent Mapping

Swarm auto-selects agents based on task keywords:

| Task Type | Primary Agents | Support Agents |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **New API** | backend-architect, graphql-architect | security-auditor, test-automator |
| **Auth System** | security-auditor, backend-security-coder | backend-architect |
| **Frontend Feature** | frontend-developer, ui-ux-designer | test-automator |
| **Database Schema** | database-architect, sql-pro | backend-architect |
| **Performance Issue** | performance-engineer, debugger | observability-engineer |
| **Code Review** | code-reviewer, architect-review | security-auditor |
| **Refactoring** | legacy-modernizer, code-reviewer | test-automator |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | deployment-engineer, devops-troubleshooter | terraform-specialist |
| **Kubernetes** | kubernetes-architect, cloud-architect | network-engineer |
| **ML Pipeline** | ml-engineer, data-scientist | mlops-engineer |
| **Documentation** | docs-architect, api-documenter | mermaid-expert |

### Model Tiers

| Tier | Model | Agent Types |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | CEO | architecture, security, code review |
| Tier 2 | Orchestrator | most specialists |
| Tier 3 | Haiku | fast operational tasks |

## The Blackboard Pattern

Agents coordinate through shared state:

**Pheromone Trails:**
- `discovery` - "Found something interesting"
- `warning` - "Be careful here"
- `blocker` - "This is broken"
- `hot` - "High activity area"

**Flow:**
1. Agents explore, leave trails
2. Other agents see trails, adjust focus
3. Findings recorded for future sessions

## When to Use Swarm

**Single agent:** Simple tasks, quick fixes, direct questions

**Swarm:** Complex investigations, architecture decisions, multi-perspective analysis

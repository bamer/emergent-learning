- Node.js 18+ or Bun (Bun recommended on Windows)
- pnpm (optional, npm works but Bun is faster)

**Optional (for Swarm features):**
- Opencode Pro or Max subscription

### Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Spacehunterz/Emergent-Learning-Framework_ELF.git
cd Emergent-Learning-Framework_ELF

# Run the installer (sets up hooks, core system)
./install.sh              # Mac/Linux
./install.ps1             # Windows (PowerShell)

# Or install manually:
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3. Validate installation
python -m query --validate
```

### Dashboard Setup

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python

**Type Hints Required**
```python
# Good
def query_heuristics(domain: str, limit: int = 10) -> list[dict]:
    pass

# Bad
def query_heuristics(domain, limit=10):
    pass
```

**Why:** Type hints improve IDE support, catch errors early, and serve as inline documentation. We use Mypy for static type checking.

**No Docstrings**
```python
# Good
def validate_claim_chain(chain_id: str) -> bool:
    integrity_check = check_signatures(chain_id)
    fraud_score = compute_fraud_risk(chain_id)
    return integrity_check and fraud_score < 0.3

# Bad
def validate_claim_chain(chain_id: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates a claim chain by checking signatures and fraud score.

    Args:
        chain_id: The ID of the claim chain to validate

    Returns:
        True if valid, False otherwise
    """
    # ... implementation
```

**Why:** Claude reads code directly, making docstrings redundant and wasteful of tokens. Descriptive names and type hints provide the necessary context. Use commit messages for "why" explanations.

**Other Python Conventions**
- Use `python -m module` over direct script execution
- Always activate virtual environment before pip operations
- Prefer `async/await` for I/O operations
- Use `thiserror` patterns for error handling (typed errors)
- Validate input at system boundaries only

### TypeScript

**Strict Mode Required**
```typescript
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

**React Conventions**
- Use refs for callbacks in effects to avoid reconnect loops (Golden Rule #9)
- Await every Promise - no floating promises
- Forward slashes in paths (cross-platform compatibility)

### Universal Rules

**No Code Comments**
```python
# Bad
# Calculate confidence score based on validations
confidence = validations / (validations + violations)

# Good (descriptive naming)
def calculate_confidence(validations: int, violations: int) -> float:
    return validations / (validations + violations)
```

**Why:** Comments waste tokens in Claude's context. Descriptive names are self-documenting. Commit messages preserve reasoning in Git history.

**Zero-Dependency Preference**

Before adding a dependency, ask:
- Can we implement this in <100 lines?
- Does the dependency add significant value?
- What's the maintenance burden?

Justify new dependencies in commit messages.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

Not applicable - PRs not currently accepted. For your own forks:
- `feature/descriptive-name`
- `fix/issue-description`
- `refactor/component-name`

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body explaining WHY, not WHAT]

[optional footer with references]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `chore`: Tooling, dependencies, etc.

**Examples:**

```
fix: resolve WebSocket reconnect loop in dashboard

React useEffect was re-running on every render because onMessage
callback was a new reference each time. Moved callback to ref,
updated ref in separate effect, used empty deps for connection.

Closes #123
```

```
feat: add temporal smoothing to confidence scores

Prevents confidence from spiking based on single data points.
Uses exponential moving average with configurable alpha.
```

### Commit Hygiene

- One logical change per commit
- Commits should be buildable and testable
- No "while we're here" changes (Golden Rule #21)
- Reference issue numbers in commit body

## Architecture Overview

### The Learning Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                LEARNING CYCLE                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. QUERY    → Check building for knowledge     │
│  2. APPLY    → Use heuristics during task       │
│  3. RECORD   → Capture outcome (success/fail)   │
│  4. PERSIST  → Update confidence scores         │
│                                                  │
│       (cycle repeats, patterns strengthen)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

```
Opencode Session
       ↓
   PreToolUse Hook → Query System → SQLite
       ↓                              ↓
   Context Injection            Heuristics DB
       ↓
   Task Execution
       ↓
   PostToolUse Hook → Record Outcome → Update Confidence
```

### Blackboard Architecture (Swarm)

```
┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│  Agent A  │────▶│ Blackboard│◀────│  Agent B  │
└───────────┘     │  (.coord/) │     └───────────┘
                  └─────┬─────┘
                        │
                  ┌─────▼─────┐
                  │  Agent C  │
                  └───────────┘
```

Agents read/write to shared state in `.coordination/` rather than direct messaging. This provides:
- Decoupling (agents don't need to know about each other)
- Observability (all state changes are logged)
- Debuggability (inspect blackboard at any point)

### Key Design Decisions

**Why SQLite?**
- Zero configuration
- File-based (no server required)
- Excellent for read-heavy workloads
- Supports concurrent reads

**Why Async/Await in Query System?**
- Non-blocking database operations
- 2.9x faster for mixed workloads (concurrent queries)
- Better resource utilization

**Why No Docstrings?**
- Claude reads code directly
- Docstrings waste context tokens
- Type hints + descriptive names are sufficient
- Git commit messages preserve "why"

**Why Blackboard over Message Passing?**
- Decouples agents (no direct dependencies)
- Observable state (all changes logged)
- Easier debugging (inspect state at any point)
- Natural fit for distributed coordination

## Testing Philosophy

### Break It Before Shipping It

Golden Rule #4: Actively try to break your solution before declaring it done.

**When writing tests, consider:**
- Edge cases (empty input, null, extremely large values)
- Race conditions (concurrent access)
- Error propagation (what happens when dependencies fail)
- Recovery scenarios (crash recovery, partial writes)

### Test Organization

Tests are organized by component and focus area:

**Unit Tests** - Single component isolation
- Fast, deterministic
- Mock external dependencies
- High coverage of edge cases

**Integration Tests** - Multi-component interaction
- Database + query system
- Blackboard + agents
- Hooks + query system

**Stress Tests** - High-load scenarios
- Concurrent database access
- Large knowledge bases
- Long-running workflows

### Writing Good Tests

```python
# Good: Descriptive name, single concern, clear assertion
def test_confidence_increases_after_validation():
    heuristic = create_heuristic(confidence=0.5)
    heuristic.record_validation()
    assert heuristic.confidence > 0.5

# Bad: Vague name, multiple concerns, unclear intent
def test_heuristic():
    h = Heuristic()
    h.validate()
    h.violate()
    assert h.conf == 0.5
```

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Documentation Path Errors** - Corrected `query.py` path in all documentation
  - Path was `query/query.py` but actual location is `src/query/query.py`
  - Fixed in: Migration.md, Architecture.md, Installation.md, IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md, issue-43-analysis.md
  - Users following docs no longer get "file not found" errors
- **Hook Path Errors** - Installers now prefer `src/hooks/` over symlinks
  - Symlinks in `hooks/learning-loop/` may not work reliably with Opencode
  - Both install.sh and install.ps1 updated to use actual files first
- **Golden Rules Not Seeded on Fresh Install** - New users now get golden rules automatically
  - install.sh: Added copy of `templates/golden-rules.md` to `memory/` directory
  - install.sh: Added `seed_golden_rules()` function called in all install modes
  - install.ps1: Added seeding step after database initialization
  - 12 foundational golden rules now populated on first install

### Changed
- **Automated /checkout** - No more prompts at session end
  - Auto-detects session activity (commits, files modified, domains)
